# Zustand Store Structure

The project uses Zustand for lightweight global state management.

useFlightStore

Handles the flight booking flow.

## Stores:

Active search query
Selected flight
Selected seat(s)
Current booking step
Passenger form data
Persistence:

## Uses Zustand Persist middleware to:

Resume booking after refresh
Restore in-progress booking state
Security:

## Sensitive fields such as:

passport number
are excluded from local storage using:

partialize()

to avoid persisting private user data.

useUserStore

Handles authenticated user state.

## Stores:

Supabase session token
Cached booking data
Persistence:

Only session-related information is persisted.

Large or sensitive user data is intentionally excluded.

Store Reset Actions

## Automatic reset actions are triggered on:

User logout
Booking cancellation

to avoid stale booking data and maintain clean application state.
